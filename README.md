# Hangman Game

Welcome to the Hangman game, written in Java with a GUI implemented using JavaFX!

This program is an implementation of the classic word guessing game "Hangman". In this game, the program selects a word from a pool of words and the user tries to guess the word by guessing one letter at a time. If the letter appears in the word, it is displayed in the appropriate positions. If the guess is incorrect, the program adds one limb to a drawing of a "hanging man".

The game continues until the user guesses the word or until the drawing of the hanging man is complete. The letters of the alphabet that have been selected so far are also displayed.

The game ends when the hanging man is completed or when the word is guessed.

## To play the Hangman game:

1. Download the program files and open them in a Java development environment with support for JavaFX.
2. Compile and run the program.
3. Follow the prompts on the screen to guess letters and try to guess the word.
4. The program will display the current state of the hanging man and the letters of the alphabet that have been selected.
5. When the game ends, the program will display whether you have won or lost.
